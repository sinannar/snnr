## This is a fun project
<p>
    When I was trying to improve my github initial page, I came across this profile, <a href="https://github.com/f">Fatih Kadir Akin's Github</a>, and I realize he created a runnable node module, or whatever it is being called since I am not much experienced with neither javascript nor npm packages.

<p>
    So here you can see I am having my fun with mostly copy pasting his code, but please go and give him a star and if there is <strong>BUY ME A COFFEE</strong> button, click that
